// Convert BST to Max-Heap

/*
Approach
1. Create an array arr[] of size n, where n is the number of nodes in the given BST.
2. Perform the inorder traversal of the BST and copy the node values in the arr[] in sorted
order.
3. Now perform the postorder traversal of the tree.
4. While traversing the root during the POSTORDER traversal, one by one copy the values from the array arr[] to the nodes.

// Convert BST to Min-Heap

/*
Approach
1. Create an array arr[] of size n, where n is the number of nodes in the given BST.
2. Perform the inorder traversal of the BST and copy the node values in the arr[] in sorted
order.
3. Now perform the postorder traversal of the tree.
4. While traversing the root during the PREORDER traversal, one by one copy the values from the array arr[] to the nodes.

// Convert min Heap to max Heap

/*
Dont care about the input just use the max-heapify algo to make the heap
