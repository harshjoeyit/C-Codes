std::sort - 

A hybrid sorting algorithm provides average and worst case time complexity of O(nlogn). The sorting algorithm which it uses is called Introsort.
Introsort is combination of both quicksort and heapsort, It begins with quicksort and switch to heapsort if recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted.

sort() function usually uses Introsort. Therefore, sort() may preserve the physical order of semantically equivalent values but can’t be guaranteed.

stable_sort() function usually uses mergesort. Therefore, stable_sort() preserve the physical order of semantically equivalent values and its guaranteed.




cross initialization error -

Occurs when variables are declared in case in the switch.
To remove error use a block {} to enclose the variables declared. 




container adapters-

both stack and queues are container adapters and implemented on deque
priorirty queue is implemented on a vector 




minimum required to compile a file -

int main() { }




Statement

We know that every statement in C++ must end with a semicolon. However, unlike other languages, almost all statements in C++ can be treated as expressions. So, if we place the statement inside an if statement with a blank pair of parentheses, we don’t have to end it with a semicolon anymore.

if (a = 1) {}
if (printf("Hello, world!\n")) {}

If we want to call a function that returns void, we cannot use that trick, as void functions are not expressions. But it can be remedied using the not so famous comma operator, with any value in the right hand side of the operator.
