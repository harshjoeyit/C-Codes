//std::chrono has two distinct objectsâ€“timepoint and duration. 
//A timepoint as the name suggests represents a point in time whereas a duration represents an interval or span of time.
//The C++ library allows us to subtract two timepoints to get the interval of time passed in between.
 //Using provided methods we can also convert this duration to appropriate units.
//The std::chrono provides us with three clocks with varying accuracy.
// The high_resolution_clock is the most accurate and hence it is used to measure execution time.



// C++ program to find out execution time of 
// of functions

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
