    /*
    Can we make copy constructor private?
    
    Yes, a copy constructor can be made private. When we make a 
    copy constructor private in a class, objects of that class
    become non-copyable. This is particularly useful when our 
    lass has pointers or dynamically allocated resources. 
    In such situations, we can either write our own copy constructor 
    like above String example or make a private copy constructor so that 
    users get compiler errors rather than surprises at runtime. 
    

    Why argument to a copy constructor must be passed as a reference?
    
    A copy constructor is called when an object is passed by value. 
    Copy constructor itself is a function. So if we pass an argument by 
    value in a copy constructor, a call to copy constructor would be made 
    to call copy constructor which becomes a non-terminating chain of calls. 
    Therefore compiler doesnâ€™t allow parameters to be passed by value.
