std::sort - 

A hybrid sorting algorithm provides average and worst case time complexity of O(nlogn). The sorting algorithm which it uses is called Introsort.
Introsort is combination of both quicksort and heapsort, It begins with quicksort and switch to heapsort if recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted.




cross initialization error -

Occurs when variables are declared in case in the switch.
To remove error use a block {} to enclose the variables declared. 




container adapters-

both stack and queues are container adapters and implemented on deque
priorirty queue is implemented on a vector 




minimum required to compile a file -

int main() { }
