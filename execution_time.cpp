std::chrono has two distinct objectsâ€“timepoint and duration. 
A timepoint as the name suggests represents a point in time whereas a duration represents an interval or span of time.
The C++ library allows us to subtract two timepoints to get the interval of time passed in between.
Using provided methods we can also convert this duration to appropriate units.
The std::chrono provides us with three clocks with varying accuracy.
The high_resolution_clock is the most accurate and hence it is used to measure execution time.
