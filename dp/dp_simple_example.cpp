/*
Vova had a pretty weird sleeping schedule. There are h hours in a day. Vova will sleep exactly n times. The i-th time he will sleep exactly after ai hours from the time he woke up. You can assume that Vova woke up exactly at the beginning of this story (the initial time is 0). Each time Vova sleeps exactly one day (in other words, h hours).

Vova thinks that the i-th sleeping time is good if he starts to sleep between hours l and r inclusive.

Vova can control himself and before the i-th time can choose between two options: go to sleep after ai hours or after aiâˆ’1 hours.

Your task is to say the maximum number of good sleeping times Vova can obtain if he acts optimally.
